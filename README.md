# Hyperion Development - Software Engineering Course
## Level 1 - Capstone Project 2 - Customise a Pygame

### Overview of this Task

This task focused on editing and adding to pre-existing code. It looked at a game that was partially completed using Pygame. We were asked to adjust the assets of the game, replacing them with our own, and then to edit the code to ensure the game worked properly and certain attributes and conditions were executed.

### Development

The program was coded in python with the Pygame library imported. We had to edit the code to make sure our 'hero' character would be able to move up, down, left and right. The object of the game was to ensure the hero didn't touch one of the moving 'villains'. The hero could avoid the villains as they passed across the screen. There was also a reward item, where if the hero managed to touch it, they won the game.

We also had to ensure that the hero character stayed within the boundary of the screen size allocated.

### Key Aspects that were worked on:

* Postional Arguments and dimensions for objects
* Key up and Key down events
* Events and actions 
* While loops
* Working with image assets

### Summary

A good introduction to importing libraries such as Pygame, and what the structure of a basic game looks like.
